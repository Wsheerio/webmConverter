[This](https://github.com/Wsheerio/webmConverter/raw/master/Executable/webmConverter.zip) should be a build of the most recent version.

You're going to need [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), I recommend grabbing one of the static builds.

Place webm.exe and the fonts folder in the same directory as ffmpeg.exe

You also need .NET Framework 4.0

Adjust

This it added to the bit-rate generated by your target file size and video length. Negative numbers will reduce the bit-rate while position numbers will increase it. Mess around with this if your output file is too big or small, if you can't get the size you want try lowering or raising the resolution.

Output

This is where you put your output file name.
