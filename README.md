Downloads
=========
The [release page](https://github.com/Wsheerio/webmConverter/releases) should have a build of the most recent version.

You're going to need [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), I recommend grabbing one of the static builds.

You also need [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)

Place WebM Converter.exe and the fonts folder in the same directory as ffmpeg.exe

Resolution

The resolution of the output file. The first number is the width, the second is the height. -1 scales the other size to keep the same aspect ratio, leave both as -1 to keep the input resolution.

Crop

This lets you crop a video\. The command looks like this, Width:Height:X:Y. Width is the width of the rectangle being cropped, height is the height, x and y are the coordinates of the rectangle being cropped. in_w and in_h grab the videos width and height respectively.

    500:500:10:10

Saturation

This lets you remove color from the output file, this is useful if you want to output to greyscale or remove a small amount of color to reduce the filesize. Note that using this to reduce filesize will only work if the file is easily fittable within the size limit. This can be a number from 0 to 1, 0 being greyscale and 1 being full color.
